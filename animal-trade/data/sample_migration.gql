# run through line of graql insertion queries that need to be implemented in the java api

# first insert aux data from the PDF
# countries/region mapping

# Approach 1: 
# check-exists queries and actions
match $c isa Country has name "USA"; get; 
insert $c isa Country has name "USA";

match $r isa Region has name "North America"; get;
insert $r isa Region has name "North America";

# in this case, don't need to check this at all
match $c isa country; $r isa region; 
insert (superlocation: $r, sublocation: $c) isa location;


# Approach 2:
match 
    $c isa country has name "USA"; $r isa region has name "North America";
insert
    (superlocation: $r, sublocation: $c) isa location;
#if fails, check both of the conditions as before, then re-run the insert-relationship
# this is actually far less elegant, though may be more efficient!


# insert all the "unique" entities

insert $c isa Country has name "USA";
insert $c isa Country has name "Germany";

# including the entire hierarchy 
insert $f isa Family has name "family";
insert $s isa Species,
    has name "species",
    has endangerment "3";


# insert all other entities that don't have to be singly-inserted
insert $m isa Measure,
    has unit "kg",
    has quantity 100;

#

# the Item object, which is one per transaction/exchange
# either an import or export
